Subject: Assistance Required: Identifying SailPoint Group for Access to [Table Name]

Hi [Recipient's Name or Team],

I hope you are well.

I am currently encountering a privileged access error when trying to access the [Table Name] table. To resolve this, I need to request the appropriate permissions through SailPoint.

Could you please guide me on which SailPoint group I need to request access to in order to gain the necessary permissions for this table? If there is any additional information required from my side, please let me know.
