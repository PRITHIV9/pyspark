Subject: Confirmation Needed: Target Location for File Loading in DM_comm_analytics

Hi [Scrum Master's Name] and [Data Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I need to create a ServiceNow ticket to set up a subfolder in DM_comm_analytics with the same folder structure as sb-dsp, as sb-dsp will be decommissioned in November 2024. The Axway team is asking for the target location to load the files.

Currently, we are loading files under sb-dsp/data/L1. Are we planning to use the same folder structure in DM_comm_analytics, or will we adopt a different structure? Please let me know so I can proceed accordingly.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
